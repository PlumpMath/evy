Evy is a port of eventlet for running in Pypy with libuv.

Quick Example
===============

Here's something you can try right on the command line::

    % python
    >>> import evy 
    >>> from evy.green import urllib2
    >>> gt = evy.spawn(urllib2.urlopen, 'http://facebook.com')
    >>> gt2 = evy.spawn(urllib2.urlopen, 'http://secondlife.com')
    >>> gt2.wait()
    >>> gt.wait()


Building the Docs Locally
=========================

To build a complete set of HTML documentation, you must have Sphinx, which can be found at
http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ (or installed with `easy_install sphinx`)

  make docs
  
The built html files can be found in doc/_build/html afterward.

Status
======

Most of the unit tests are running now, but it doesn't work yet...
